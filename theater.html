        LUBOV. He's talking rubbish. There's no General at all.<br>

GAEV. Here they are.<br>

ANYA. Mother's sitting down here.<br>

LUBOV. [Tenderly] Come, come, my dears.... [Embracing ANYA and VARYA] If

[All sit down.]<br>

LOPAKHIN. Our eternal student is always with the ladies.<br>

TROFIMOV. That's not your business.<br>

LOPAKHIN. He'll soon be fifty, and he's still a student.<br>
